Hi, I'm Tama.
I'm awesome.

I love to travel. I'm here on Earth to learn, love, dance, play, experience, and help all of us reach a fuller potential.

I dream of future human societies as sustainable, fun, beautiful, diverse ecosystems that are cared for and made better by humans.

My intention is to fill this website with my ideas and projects.
